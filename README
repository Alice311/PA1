This program will read in email data files and populate a hash table with these email addresses,
 then allow for user interaction with the data. The user will enter email addresses to check 
if they are spam by looking into the hash table

How to compile

    To compile this program, simply navigate to the directory containing the
source files for PA1 (which should include the Makefile) and type 'make'.

    To run the program, type the executable name followed by an integer
argument.
